# semantic-image-search
Demonstration application for 2023 Nashville Analytics Summit - Do I really need a vector database?

## Environment

The environment file is defined in environment.yml and is intended to be used with [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). Run the following to automatically create a new environment named vectordb.

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

You will also need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose to spin up Milvus.

## Data

### Getting the images

This application makes use of [The Unsplash Dataset](https://github.com/unsplash/datasets), although any large set of images can be used. For the demo application, I requested and gained access to the full dataset of 4.8M images, although I only used 500K due to the size of the dataset. The lite dataset (25K images) is freely available from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/data/lite/latest) and on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandaramg/unsplash-image-download-data). These datasets do not contain the images, you will need to scrape them from the links provided in the photos reference table.

`python pull_images.py <path-to-photos.tsv000>`

This should create a data/raw directory. Note that these images are quite largeâ€”even the lite dataset takes up ~75GB of disk space.

### Resizing the images

### Encoding the images

## Vector Database

### Setting up Milvus

### Setting up Attu (optional)

## Streamlit

At this point, you should be able to run the application. If you created a user for this application (highly suggested), set the environmental variables in the shell before running the below command or [modify the secrets file in your local streamlit install](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/secrets-management).

`streamlit run --server.port 8080 --server.maxUploadSize 10 --browser.gatherUsageStats false ss-milvus.py`

Feel free to change the port or upload limit. `--browser.gatherUsageStats false` simply deactivates telemetry.
